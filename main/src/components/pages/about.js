                  I am a full stack web developer looking for opportunities in
                  contributing to a highly collaborative work environment,
                  finding solutions, and determining customer satisfaction. I
                  have proven experience developing websites using HTML, CSS,
                  and JavaScript. I have designed and developed web applications
                  across multiple APIs, third-party integrations, and databases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My current skillset includes HTML/CSS, Javascript, jQuery,
                  React, Node.js, SQL, and Express.js. I enjoy learning new
                  skills, discovering the intracacies of the web, and
                  challenging myself creatively.

                  If I am not working on improving my code, you can find me
                  reading the next Haruki Murakami novel or painting. My cat,
                  Goose, is my muse and best distraction.
